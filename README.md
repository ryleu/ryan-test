The goal is to build a webpage that can tell a user the weather forecast for any given city/zip code/address that a user would type into a text box.

1) front end should utilize html/css/javascript (potentially using angular or react as a framework) and call a back end service that you wrote. Bonus if you can detect the user’s location automatically. (look up the “fetch” method build into javascript)
2) back end should make api calls to some weather forecast service (there are a few free ones available, but you may need to sign up for a free account). Ideally this would be done in node - bonus points if you can use “serverless offline”. Triple bonus points if you can see how to actually host it in a free AWS account
3) code for front end and back end should be checked into source control (your best bet there would be GitHub - also free)
4) a stretch goal would be to make users register/log in for your “service”. You’d integrate your back end code to talk to a database to save user information
